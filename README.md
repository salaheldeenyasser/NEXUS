## Abstract

Traditional security systems rely on single-factor authentication (keys, NFC cards, keypads), making them vulnerable to spoofing. This project introduces a **versatile multi-factor authentication control unit** that enhances both **security and usability**.

### Key Features:
- Face detection & recognition
- Fingerprint scanning
- Keypad entry
- Smartphone remote access with live video
- Configurable authentication layers (1–3 factors)
- Role-based access: **Admin** and **Normal User**
- IoT integration via **Blynk** for remote control
- Intuitive GUI on Raspberry Pi touch screen

**Target Application:** Smart door lock  
**Use Cases:** Bank lockers, high-security labs, control rooms, offices
